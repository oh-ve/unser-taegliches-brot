        In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
        frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
        parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners
        will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not
        unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live
        Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water
        Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors;
        but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners;
        savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It
        makes a stranger stare.
